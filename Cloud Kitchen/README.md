# Bhukkad: A Cloud Kitchen Concept.

### About:
<storng>Note: This entire concept is theoretical.</strong><br>
Bhukkad is an application. It is based on cloud kitchen concept. It reduces the gap between customer and restaurant. It uses concept like Zomato. It allows restaurant to upload it's details and menu items. The user can select from a range of food from different restaurants. <br>
The major difference from Zomato model and Bhukkad application is about it's independent delivery system. The delivery person and the chain is not owned by Bhukkad. Rather it is open to customers who wanna register as delivery person. Although, the entire process is controlled by the Bhukkad organisation. <br>
